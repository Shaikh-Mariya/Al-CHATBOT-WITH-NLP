DESCRIOTON : This code creates a simple chatbot using the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) library in Python. It begins by importing necessary modules, specifically the Chat class and reflections, which facilitate conversational interactions. The core of the chatbot is defined in the pairs variable, which contains a list of patterns and corresponding responses. Each pattern is a regular expression that the chatbot uses to match user input; when a match is found, the chatbot replies with one of the predefined responses. For instance, if a user states "my name is Payal," the chatbot responds with "Hello Payal, how can I help you today?" After defining these patterns and responses, the code creates an instance of the chatbot using the Chat class and initiates the conversation with the converse() method. This allows users to interact with the chatbot, which will continue to respond until the user decides to exit by typing "quit" or "exit." Overall, the code sets up a basic yet functional chatbot capable of engaging in simple conversations.
